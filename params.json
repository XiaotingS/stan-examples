It requires a response variable y coded as 0 or 1 and an x matrix of predictor variables (with a column of 1's if you want an intercept). The model returns beta coefficients that represent the marginal effect of a one unit change on the latent utility scale. It also returns estimates of the latent utility for each observation. Location is fixed by assuming that y=1 if ystar>0, and scale is fixed by assuming that the variance of the latent error term is 1.\r\n","google":"UA-65548469-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
